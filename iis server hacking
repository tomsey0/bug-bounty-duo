Hacking IIS Servers  (IIS stands for Internet Information Service)

 Finding hidden files and folders on IIS servers
 
 Microsoft ASP.NET fingetprinting
 
   1)Things you should look for:-
   
       1)cookies:-
          -> ASP.NET_SessionId
          -> ASPSESSION
       
       2)Header Regex:-
          -> X-AspNet-Version(.+)\\;version:\\1
          -> XPowered-By:^ASP\\.NET
          
       3)HTML Regex:-
           <input[^>]+name=\"__VIEWSTATE
           
       4)URL Regex:-
           \\.aspx?(?:$|\\?)
       
  2)Extentions you should look for:-
 
   .asp    (legacy active server pages)
   .aspx   (Modern active server pages)
   .ashx   (APIs\AJAX)
   .wsdl   (web service description language)
   .wadl   (web application description language)
   .asmx   (XML web services)
   .xml    (extensible markup language)
   .zip    (archive zip)
   .txt    (text file)
   .axd    (used in handling embedded)
   .ascx   (web user control file)
   .backup (backup files)
   .config
   .php
 
 3)Finding API Documentation
   
   1)look for .ASMX files  (we <3 .ASMX files)
   2)look for .ASHX files
   3)look for APIs
   4)look for api Documentation
   
   
 4)What can you do by hacking IIS servers:-
 
   -> Case sensetive, amazing for content discovery
   -> Bruteforce IIS shortnames
   -> VIEWSTATE deserilization RCE gadget
   -> web.config upload tricks
   -> Debug mode w/ detailed stack traces and full paths
   -> Debugging Scripts often deployed (ELMAN,Trace)
   -> Talerik RCE
   -> Complex XXE vectors
   
   
5)Logical fuzzing of Files and Folders

   -> After fuzzing shortname enumeration on your target,you may endup with:-
                            ASPNET?
                            LIDSDI?
                            LIDSSE?
                            LIDSTE?
                            EASYFI?
      As we can see we get couple of folder that has been detected,but not the full foldername that has been detected,
      just a partial foldername as IIS-Shortname-Scanner does.
      
      Now What???
       ->Try to findout most logical cutoff name 
             for example:- For ffuf, you would put the following fuzzing pattern:-
                                        LIDSDI____   ---> LIDSFUZZ
                                        LIDSSE____   ---> LIDSFUZZ
                                        EASYFI____   ---> EASYFUZZ
                         => ./fuff -w wordlist.txt -D -e asp,aspx,ashx,asmx -t 1000 -c -u http://redircted/lidsFUZZ
       
       -> You will get awesome results...
       
       *** Try to create custom wordlists
           ./crunch 0 3 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789 -o customwordlist.txt
           
       ***Look for common files
      
      Means,
      Using IIS-Shortname-scanner, get you 50% of the way there,by giving you the shortname of files and folders.
      
      How can you find out the rest of the foldername:-
      
      i) Bruteforce the rest of the file and foldername,purely using existing wordlist or generating wordlist of charactors (0-5 chars,a-2,0-9 etc).
      ii)Bruteforce the rest of the file or foldername,by using regexes on the github dataset from Big Query.
